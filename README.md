MALTI Tool (Malware's Technical Investigation Tool) 🛡️
A centralized tool for malware analysis and digital forensics investigation.

Project Overview
The MALTI Tool is a centralized web application that helps with malware analysis and digital forensics investigations. It provides a suite of functionalities to validate and investigate various types of digital data, addressing key challenges in the field, such as the fragmentation of available tools and the need for more reliable results.

Key Features
Centralized Platform 💻
This tool consolidates multiple forensic and validation tools into a single, user-friendly application.

Hash Calculation 🔗
The tool calculates hash values for uploaded files and compares them with open-source data to check for similar malware globally. This allows a malware researcher to understand a malware's behavior and helps organizations develop better security systems.

Data Validation Modules ✅
The MALTI Tool has various modules to check for malicious content and provide essential information about different data types:

Email Validation: Verifies if an email address is legitimate by checking its syntax, format, and domain. This can help prevent phishing attacks by identifying suspicious addresses.

File Validation: Uses multiple antivirus scanners to check uploaded files for malicious content like viruses or Trojans. It provides a detailed report including hash values (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) and a "harm status".

Phone Number Validation: Checks if a phone number is valid and provides details like location, country code, and network provider.

URL Validation: Confirms if a URL is correctly formatted.

IP Validation: Checks for a valid IP address and provides sensitive data like city, country code, and geographical coordinates.

File Behavioral Analysis: Observes a file running in a controlled lab environment to understand its registry, file system, process, and network activities.

SWOT Analysis
Strengths 💪: The tool has updated anti-malware and anti-virus programs and provides validation techniques for user input.
Weaknesses 📉: It is dependent on APIs and relies on the end user's knowledge of the cybersecurity market.
Opportunities 📈: New security systems and products are constantly entering the market , and the tool is adaptive to future needs.
Threats 👾: The project faces threats from new viruses, malicious content, and hacking/phishing attacks.

Getting Started

Python, SQL Server, and Django.
System Requirements
Hardware: 4 GB RAM, 1 TB Disk Space.
Software: Visual Studio Code.
Operating System: Windows or Linux.

Future Enhancements 🚀
The development team plans to:
Make the source code more secure.
Add more advanced technology and libraries to make it a more complete package.
Beautify the UI to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
Add more forensics collection tools to help with investigations.
